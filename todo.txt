REDESIGN ALL THE PAGES
- sharer page. this describes what is the plugin page and how to implement it.
    - if the customer has not created any sharer yet, we display the message leading him to create sharers
    - give instruction that he can apply the iframe. 
    - need have client_key
    - have a demo page which links to client_key/user_id=0
    - give the iframe code

- action page. this descibes how to use the action page. also, client is to define the actions here
    - instruction
    - form/table for  all actions
    - instruction on recording those actions
- api documentation. this describes the api. apisettings is the place to define all the actions and how to use them.this page should have a left navigation bar. 
- setting page. this page includes client_key, api_key and the action table defined.

PLANOUT API
- api key should be 30 integers
- I'd prefer the foursquare style. give different urls. rather than uwaterloo style
- section 1. how to record api actions.
- section 2. number of clicks group by sharer. default is sort by clicks DESC
- section 3. number of action type 1 group by sharer. default is sort by clicks DESC
- section 4. one sharer's number of clicks, number of actions for each action type
- section 5.  api plugin title and body
- section 6. action type list
- section 7. referrer breakdown for one sharers' number of clicks
-


- AllSharerSummary (This is the table I return at the default page), ClickMoreThan is one paramester
- SingleSharer (clicks break down by referrer, action breakdown by referrer, time)
- SharerPageMessage (return title and body)
- MyActions (action table)

TODO:
- need have a better url validation
- create_sharers take multiple queries. need fix it
- how to replace request.user with customer while login
- deal with successfully update update_title_and_body message
- tabs need add active code.
- also, do i need validate the post ls from change_redirect_link, disable and enable
- give api_setting_error on apisettins page
- display_sharers takes customer id and return sum of clicks, also sum of actions group by action_name
- need completely contruct the api page
- both dashboard and action table needs add checkbox and individual action functionality. 
- ToggleSharerForm, customer_sharer_identifier could have a max_value



new features and implementation
- click is the higher level of all the actions
- I will send click_id along with the redirect link. i.e. textyard.com/?woclickid=xxxxxxx
- the customer will store this id and eventually send it along with the actions

    DB change
    - Action_type table: my client defines all the actions along with points
        - id
        - Customer_id
        - action_name
        - description
        - enabled
        - created

    - Actions: the actual api request sent by my client
        - id
        - click_id
        - actions_id
        - description
        - created

- Customer table will have two keys. client_key and api_key.  client key is used for the iframe. api key is used for the api request.

- the request is like: api.wordout.me/?
    api_key=XXXXXXXX&
    woclickid=XXXXXXX&
    action=STRING&
    description=XXXXXXXXX&
    code=XXXXXX
    {response: {Status: ok/fail, Message: SUCCESS OR ERROR MESSAGE}}

- "Compose codes" is going to be "Add users"
- "Edit links" is going to be "Edit"
- "Disable" button
- check box at the front of User ID (version 2)
- select all method (version 2)


- pages
    - dashboard page is the anaylisis table that includes "ADD USERS", "CHANGE LINKS", "DISABLE", user_id, link, clicks, other actions, enable, pagination
    - page plugin
        - instruction on how to implement the iframe. basically, give client key along with user id
    - api
        - first define actions
        - give instruction on how to send http request to our server

    - other statistics page, includes clicks by referrer
    - my keys
        - client key
        - api key

- user_id 0 should be a test code


- show action tables on the iframe. no need to record any points






- we don't want to store proxy ip
- fix my parse http issue if there is
- need write the api page.
    - message_title
    - message_body
    - points = 1* 100
    - referral code input
    - facebook link
    - twitter link
    - powered by wordout.me
- have all external functions as module.function
- why adding verify_exitto URLfieldwill give me error 
- better error msg and design for form errors
- validate all the request info at direct_page
