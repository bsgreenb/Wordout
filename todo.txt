PLANOUT API
- I have an account page that includes user's client_key, api_key and action table. 
- the table is like my current table. we have all action buttons on the top. at the first version, the user can create max 5 actions. action buttons include "add [] actions", "edit action" and "disable action"
    - add [] actions. [] is a select box for number of actionst the user wants to create. this number's max is from max_action minus number of exsiting actions. once clicked, it pops out a modal which has (action_name + description) * number of actions. The input will be like data[0]['action_name'], data[0]['description']. To simplify the error msg, I redirect the page along with the form once the error occurs. 
    - i handle the validation through forms. I give request.POST['data'][0] as the variable. 
    - 

- I have an api documentation page.



TODO:
- display_sharers takes customer id and return sum of clicks, also sum of actions group by action_name
- need completely contruct the api page
- both dashboard and action table needs add checkbox and individual action functionality. 




new features and implementation
- click is the higher level of all the actions
- I will send click_id along with the redirect link. i.e. textyard.com/?woclickid=xxxxxxx
- the customer will store this id and eventually send it along with the actions

    DB change
    - Action_type table: my client defines all the actions along with points
        - id
        - Customer_id
        - action_name
        - description
        - enabled
        - created

    - Actions: the actual api request sent by my client
        - id
        - click_id
        - actions_id
        - description
        - created

- Customer table will have two keys. client_key and api_key.  client key is used for the iframe. api key is used for the api request.

- the request is like: api.wordout.me/?
    api_key=XXXXXXXX&
    woclickid=XXXXXXX&
    action=STRING&
    description=XXXXXXXXX&
    code=XXXXXX
    {response: {Status: ok/fail, Message: SUCCESS OR ERROR MESSAGE}}

- "Compose codes" is going to be "Add users"
- "Edit links" is going to be "Edit"
- "Disable" button
- check box at the front of User ID (version 2)
- select all method (version 2)


- pages
    - dashboard page is the anaylisis table that includes "ADD USERS", "CHANGE LINKS", "DISABLE", user_id, link, clicks, other actions, enable, pagination
    - page plugin
        - instruction on how to implement the iframe. basically, give client key along with user id
    - api
        - first define actions
        - give instruction on how to send http request to our server

    - other statistics page, includes clicks by referrer
    - my keys
        - client key
        - api key

- user_id 0 should be a test code


- show action tables on the iframe. no need to record any points






- we don't want to store proxy ip
- fix my parse http issue if there is
- need write the api page.
    - message_title
    - message_body
    - points = 1* 100
    - referral code input
    - facebook link
    - twitter link
    - powered by wordout.me
- have all external functions as module.function
- why adding verify_exitto URLfieldwill give me error 
- better error msg and design for form errors
- validate all the request info at direct_page
