new features and implementation
- click is the higher level of all the actions
- I will send click_id along with the redirect link. i.e. textyard.com/?woclickid=xxxxxxx
- the customer will store this id and eventually send it along with the actions

    DB change
    - Action_type table: my client defines all the actions along with points
        - id
        - Customer_id
        - action_name
        - description
        - enabled
        - created

    - Actions: the actual api request sent by my client
        - id
        - click_id
        - actions_id
        - description
        - created

- Customer table will have two keys. client_key and api_key.  client key is used for the iframe. api key is used for the api request.

- the request is like: api.wordout.me/?
    api_key=XXXXXXXX&
    woclickid=XXXXXXX&
    action=STRING&
    description=XXXXXXXXX&
    code=XXXXXX
    {response: {Status: ok/fail, Message: SUCCESS OR ERROR MESSAGE}}

- "Compose codes" is going to be "Add users"
- "Edit links" is going to be "Edit"
- "Disable" button
- check box at the front of User ID (version 2)
- select all method (version 2)

    - message_title
    - message_body
    - points = 1* 100
    - referral code input
